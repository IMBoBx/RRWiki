## What technologies and materials were used?

- Icons are imported from [Ionicons](https://ionic.io/ionicons).
- Fonts are imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

## What's so special about this website?

I feel like an HTML website heavily outshines WordPress and similar template-imported websites in the long run. You have complete control over all elements and how they look, and there is almost no limitations to what you can do, thus ensuring that all you'll need along the line is minor tweaks and additions to the site rather than a full rework or immigration.

## How to use the website?

To color text wrap it in a bold tag with either class="gold" or class="yellow".(example:  `<b class="gold"> This text is gold colored </b>` This won't make the font bold, it will just modify the color.

## TODO:

- CURVES. OMG IT'S SO CURVY!!1! (Shape dividers and hikul)
- Images.

## Final words:

WOW! I did not expect this to be a project of such scale.. All the hyped people eagerly waiting to see every new site update. All the staff members being really nice and welcoming, it was a hell of an experience and it surely pushed me to ensure that no one is let down by the final product.
